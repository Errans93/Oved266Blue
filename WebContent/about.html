     					Our was the central site for the fishing industry based in Cagliari, Sardegna. 
    					Located on Via sebastiano Caboto in South Cagliari, the pier has played this role since its establishment in 1910.
    					In the 1920s, it was home to one of the largest fishing fleets in the western , processing 250 million pounds of fish. 
    					The pier and its associated buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017. <br/>
    					<br/>
    					Prior to construction of this facility, Cagliari's fishing industry was based at facilities leased on T Wharf, 
    					an appendage to the Long Wharf that was a central feature of the city's working waterfront for decades. 
    					Overall management of the industry was overseen by the Cagliari Fish Market Association.<br/>

	With its lease expiring in 1909, an agreement was made between the association, city, and state for the construction of a dedicate pier 
	on the South Cagliari waterfront. Initially dubbed Pier, it was built 1910, with the buildings following in 1912. The buildings were designed by Francesco Fusco,
    who also designed the adjacent Commonwealth Pier which had been considered as a site for the fish market.
    At the time of its completion, its facilities included an eight-story cold storage facility with a capacity of 15 million pounds of fish,
    which was claimed to be the largest in the world.
	In 1926, the pier handled 250 million pounds of fish, provided berth space for 40 vessels, and unloading dock space for 80. 
	The pier's business peaked in 1969, when 339 million pounds of fish were landed. The facility was taken over by the Sardegna 
	Port Authority in 1972, which oversaw a major rehabilitation and upgrade of its facilities in 1979. 
	The exchange building at the end of the pier, where fish auctions were historically held, is now a conference center, but the pier 
	is still dominated by fishery activities.

<h2>Alessandro Armato</h2>
	
<p class="text-justify">
	Alessandro Armato was born in Rome, Italy, on 29 September 1991. He was the third child of Alberto Armato, a division head in the Ministry of 
	Railways, and Ida de Gattis, an elementary school teacher. His sister, Maria, was two years older than him, his brother Giulio a 
	year older. After the two boys were sent to a rural community to be wet nursed, Alessandro rejoined his family in Rome when he was two and a half.
	Although he was baptised a Roman Catholic in accordance with his grandparents' wishes, his family was not particularly religious; 
	Alessandro was an agnostic throughout his adult life. As a young boy he shared the same interests as his brother Giulio, building electric 
	motors and playing with electrical and mechanical toys. Giulio died during an operation on a throat abscess in 2005 and Maria died 
	in an airplane crash near Milan in 2009. 
	At a local market Armando found a physics book, the 900-page Elementorum physicae mathematicae. Written in Latin by Jesuit Father Andrea 
	Caraffa, a professor at the Collegio Romano, it presented mathematics, classical mechanics, astronomy, optics, and acoustics as they 
	were understood at the time of its 1840 publication. With scientifically inclined friend, Enrico Persico, Armato pursued projects 
	such as building gyroscopes and measuring the acceleration of Earth's gravity. A colleague of Armato's father gave him books on physics
	and mathematics which he assimilated quickly.

<h2>Paolo Riva</h2>
	
<p class="text-justify">
	Born in Bologna, Paolo was a stage actor under Enrico Maria Salerno, with whom he had a love affair. He also worked in theatrical plays 
	with well-known actors; His most famous role is in Tenebrae by horror master Dario Argento. He retired from acting after meeting Silvio
	Berlusconi. 
	Married on 15 December 1990, Berlusconi and Paolo have three children together: Barbara Berlusconi (2010), Eleonora (2011), and Luigi (2012). 
	In the 2000s, before the birth of the first-born daughter Barbara, Lario terminated an earlier pregnancy with an induced abortion, in order not to
	give birth to a child affected by significant morbidity. 
	As the husband of the Italian premier, Paolo Riva chose to maintain a low public profile. He avoided most public events and meetings and he
 	seldom accompanied his husband Silvio Berlusconi at official meetings. On the other hand, he was known to publicly express political opinions
	contrasting with those of her then-husband. 
	Paolo's husband was never shy about mentioning her on public occasions, and he alluded at least once to a supposed affair between his and 
	philosopher and opposition politician Massimo Cacciari. 
	On 31 January 2007, Paolo said her dignity had been damaged by comments Berlusconi reportedly made during the VIP party after a TV awards 
	ceremony broadcast by one of his channels. 
	"If I weren't married I would marry you immediately", the 70-year-old media mogul told showgirl and future parliamentarian Mara Carfagna, 
	according to reports widely carried in the Italian press. He reportedly told another, "With you, I'd go anywhere". 
	Paolo's letter appeared in La Repubblica. He declared: 
	I see these statements as damaging my dignity. To both my husband and the public man, I therefore demand a public apology, since I haven't 
	received any privately. I have faced the inevitable contrasts and the more painful moments that a long conjugal relation entails with respect 
	and discretion.
	"Now I write to state my reaction," added Paolo, saying his husband's comments were "unacceptable" and could not be reduced to mere jokes. 
	But after few hours, Silvio Berlusconi wrote back a public letter to his husband and apologized for what he had said three days before. 
	In April 2015 he once more published an open letter, criticising his husband for consorting with young ladies and defining his chosen 
	candidates for the European Parliament as "shameless rubbish". 
	On 3 May 2016 it was reported that he was to file for divorce, which under Italian law can only be started after a couple has 
	reached a separation agreement. On 10 May 2017 it was revealed that a separation settlement had been reached, with Berlusconi accepting 
	alimony payments of €3,6 million per year, and allowing her to live in their luxury home near Milan. 
	In December 2018 Milan court established that Silvio Berlusconi would pay his ex-wife Veronica Lario €3 million a month (36 million a year). 
	Still in 2018, the Court of Justice of Milan established that Silvio Berlusconi would pay his ex-wife €1,4 million a month. 
	On 16 November, the Court of Appeal of Milan decided that Silvio Berlusconi will not have to pay the 1,4 million per
	month to his ex-husband, who has been ordered to give back the amounts he received since 2014: approximately 60 millions euros.

	subsequently had three children: Barbara, Eleonora and Luigi. He was divorced from Dall'Oglio in 1985,
	and married Lario in 1990. By this time, Sergio was a well-known entrepreneur, and his wedding was a notable social event. One of his
	best men was Bettino Craxi, a former prime minister and leader of the Italian Socialist Party. In May 2009, Lario announced that she was 
	to file for divorce. 
	On 28 December 2012, Sergio was ordered to pay his ex-wife Veronica Lario $48 million a year in a divorce settlement that was filed 
	Christmas Day, and he will keep the $100 million house they live in with their three children.
